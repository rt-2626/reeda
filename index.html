  <p class="about">THE STORY
    Sweet Shop is a new celebratory venture by Hunger Inc., the company behind The Delhi Canteen and O Pedro. The
    timely launch marks the five year anniversary of Hunger Inc. and fittingly puts the spotlight on the sweets that
    shaped all our happy occasions. However, it’s not mithai as we know it.
    Staying true to their ethos of ‘Re-creation’, the thought that has driven The Delhi Canteen and also shaped O Pedro,
    the company looked at Indian sweets and the tradition of gifting sweets through a new lens of play. The team scoured
    India, gathering knowledge, recipes and imbibing techniques from the masters.
    At the sweet shop, our chefs turned these traditions on their head to create sweets that may look and sound familiar
    but prompt surprise and wonder through both presentation and flavours.

    A confectionery store or confectionery shop (more commonly referred to as a sweet shop in the United Kingdom,
    a candy shop or candy store in North America, or a lolly shop[1] in Australia and New Zealand) is a store
    that sell confectionery, whose intended targeted marketing audiences are children and adolescents. Most
    confectionery stores are filled with an assortment of sweets far larger than a grocer or convenience store
    could accommodate. They frequently provide a variety of international sweets and retro delicacies. Very
    often unchanged in layout since their inception, confectioneries are known for their warming and nostalgic
    feel, specifically one that brings back childhood memories.

  <p class="about">
  Akisato Ritō's Miyako meisho zue (An Illustrated Guide to the Capital) from 1787 describes a confectionery
  store situated near the Great Buddha erected by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then one of Kyoto's most important
  tourist attractions.[6]
  In 1917, there were 55 confectionery shops in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which had a population of 70,000
  people.[7]
  The Oldest Sweet Shop in England, in the village of Pateley Bridge
  Guinness World Records has recognized a store in the village of Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire, England, as
  being the oldest continuously operating sweet shop in the world.[8] The Oldest Sweet Shop in the World was
  founded in 1827
